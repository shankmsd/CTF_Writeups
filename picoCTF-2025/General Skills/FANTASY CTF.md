FANTASY CTF SIMULATION

The simulation begins in the private room of Eibhilin, a bright, young student.
The room is dimly lit, with the glow of her multiple monitors casting an
electric blue hue on the walls. Around the room are posters of vintage movies
from the MCU — ancient guardians from another age staring down like digital
sentinels.

Eibhilin stretches back in her chair, adjusting the holo-display of her
keyboard. A soft hum of a nearby server fills the air as her AI companion,
`Nyx`, comes to life.

---
(Press Enter to continue...)
---

"Good evening, Ei," Nyx chirps, "The 3025 edition of picoCTF registration is
open. You asked me to remind so you could try out the competition for the first
time. Do you wish to proceed?"

Outside, the city of Nexalus glimmers under the stars, but Eibhilin's focus
remains entirely on the screen in front of her.

---
(Press Enter to continue...)
---

"Yes, Nyx. Let's do it!"

---
(Press Enter to continue...)
---

Nyx brings up the registration page.

Options:
A) *Register multiple accounts*
B) *Share an account with a friend*
C) *Register a single, private account*
[a/b/c] > c

Nyx nods, "Good choice, Ei. Let's proceed with a single, private account. It
can be tempting to try and do something 'clever', but registering multiple
accounts or sharing an account with a friend can lead to disqualification."

---
(Press Enter to continue...)
---

"Ok," Nyx says, "Registering you for the competition... There's an introductory
audio message, piping to your speakers."

---
(Press Enter to continue...)
---

"Welcome hacker! You're about to embark on a journey that will teach you many
esoteric and valuable skills. Our mission is to guide you in the right path,
that you may use these skills to protect and defend and never for selfish gain
or deceit. We hope you enjoy the challenges that our authors have devised this
year. Always remember: 'With great power, comes great responsibility!'"

Nyx continues, "I've gleaned from the Ether that in CTF competitions, it's
always good to start with the 'sanity' challenge. It should be the challenge
worth the least amount of points. I'll pull it up. You're looking for something
called the flag. You should know it when you see it."

---
(Press Enter to continue...)
---

"Oh interesting," Eibhilin says, "It seems like the sanity challenge is an old
school interactive fiction game."

---
(Press Enter to continue...)
---

Options:
A) *Play the game*
B) *Search the Ether for the flag*
[a/b] > a

"Good choice, Ei," Nyx says, "You never want to share flags or artifact
downloads."

Nyx says, "Great job, Ei! I've read that a lot of players create writeups of
interesting challenges they solve during the competition. Just be sure to wait
to publish them until after the winners have been announced. We can work on
that together if you'd like."

"Thanks, Nyx! Here's the flag I found: picoCTF{m1113n1um_3d1710n_xxxxxxxx}"

"Great, you just got 10 points!" Nyx exclaims.

## Challenge 🧩

Operator, could you decode this telegram for us into plain English? We recently got this telegram from across the ocean in the United States and transcribed what we heard from the telegraph sounder, but we don't know what it means.

HINT: Some of these letters don't mean anything in the Morse code we use here in Europe. Could they be in some American style encoding?

## Solution 🕵️‍♂️

The given morse code contains both International Morse Code and American Morse Code, We need translate them accordingly.
